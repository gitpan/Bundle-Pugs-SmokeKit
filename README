Bundle::Pugs::SmokeKit
======================

  ### This bundle is obsoleted in favor of Task::Smoke. ###
  ### Please install that instead.                      ###

Pugs is an experimental implementation of Perl 6. It does not have many
prerequisites by itself: merely perl 5.6.1 or 5.8.3, and a decently
new ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

If you wish to run the powerful smoke test system that comes with pugs,
however, you'll need these modules. Once installed, you can run a smoke
test and generate a colorful smoke.html by running the following command
in the pugs build directory:

  make smoke

You are encouraged to submit your results to the public smokeserver,
especially if you run on an uncommon platform:

  perl util/smokeserv/smoke-client.pl smoke.html
